intro: "I’m kind of in love with Todo lists, which is a bit sad really. I make lists all the time and love ticking things off. Sometimes I write things that I’ve already done, just to put a line through it."

<p>I’m kind of in love with Todo lists, which is a bit sad really. I make lists all the time and love ticking things off. Sometimes I write things that I’ve already done, just to put a line through it.</p>

<p>I’ve tried most of the popular todo list apps out there and the one I keep coming back to is Google Tasks. It’s simple, free, saves to my Gmail account so I don’t need to log into anything else, and it works with loads of different mobile apps, meaning my tasks are everywhere and always synced.</p>

<p>The trouble is, there’s no real good way of using Google Tasks in a desktop browser.</p>

<p>Google stopped developing their tasks browser app years ago and it looks pretty dated now, and not a great thing to look at for long periods of time.</p>

<p>I decided to add my own styles on top of Google Tasks, just for me really. I wanted to make a thing I stare at every day better and easier to use. I took away some of the noise, made certain things more useable and generally made it more satisfying to check off tasks.</p>

<p>It’s not amazing, the code is pretty horrible and there are loads of things I’d like to improve, but it’s a bit better.</p>

<p>My friend Matt turned my styles into a browser extension, which was very kind of him. If you use Google Chrome you can have it for free here:</p>
