  After nearly two years and 75 blog posts I’ve decided to stop posting to my <a href="http://dayoffwithsophie.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Daddy daycare blog</a>. It’s the end of a (very happy) blogging era. I’m still taking Tuesdays off with Sophie but the blog will be no more.
</p>

<p>
  “But why?” I hear you say (If you happen to follow it and happen to be bothered).

<p>
  There are a few reasons, but I think the main one is that Sophie is no longer a ‘generic looking baby’. She’s morphed, much quicker than expected, into a little girl with wild curly hair who eats more breakfast than her mum and talks all the time and and can write herself (well, ‘m’ for mummy, so early days). It’s starting to feel a bit odd, me pretending to write in her voice when she has one of her own now.

<p>
  But more importantly, as a dad I’m starting to feel a bit uneasy sharing so many pictures of her online in public, now that she’s a lot more recognisable. I’m not a paranoid person when it comes to online security, and I’ve been careful to not share any ‘this is our house’ photos, but I’m also aware that you can build a picture of what Sophie’s like and where we live by looking at posts over time, and I’ve had a nagging feeling in the back of my mind when blogging recently, which is probably a good sign that it’s time to stop.

<h2>A bit of history</h2>

<p>
  I started the daddy daycare blog back in 2013, just as I switched to working part time. It was a challenge to myself, to do something new every week, get out of the house, explore our surroundings and share with family what we got up to in the day.     It’s definitely made life more fun, enjoyable and interesting.
</p>

<p>
  I didn’t expect that so many people would follow along and respond like they have done. Something that I thought only my mum would read has ended up becoming checked by lots of people every week, more than I know personally. It’s opened up lots of doors for me, from conversations to travel opportunities and giving talks in different places. And having a regular rhythm of  writing (something I really struggle with) has been great, along with editing and ordering photos at speed on my phone whilst cooking tea. I’ve loved it.
</p>


<h2>What next</h2>
<p>
  As I said earlier, I’m still taking Tuesdays off with Sophie, and we’ll still go on adventures. I think I’ll keep the blog online for a bit, and then I’ll probably take it down and make a photo book that we can look at when we’re old and wrinkly.
