  Eden Project Communities is a national social action platform (formally called the Big Lunch). As part of Yoomee, and in partnership with the Eden team in Cornwall I created a logo, a custom font, brand guidelines, and designed and built the website in Drupal.

<p>A key visual theme of the brand is the idea of a community pin board - lots of ideas coming together from different people and places. All the content on the site, including curated social media is organised by these summary cards, and grouped into themes. There is always somewhere interesting to go to next.</p>
