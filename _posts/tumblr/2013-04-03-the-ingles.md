  "A while back my friend Gaz approached me and asked if I would paint a picture of his house with words on top of it as a surprise birthday gift for his wife. Not what I normally do but I had some free time and thought I’d say yes."

The words are different Bible verses that mean something to them and are all kind of related to the house in some way. A while back they moved from a quite nice part of Sheffield to a fairly rough part of the city with an Eden team, and they do lots of great things with young people on the streets. An inspirational couple!
