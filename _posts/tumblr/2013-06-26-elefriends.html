  One of the most rewarding and well-used projects I've worked on at <a href="http://yoomee.com">Yoomee</a>, Elefriends is an online community for people who struggle with mental health issues. A closed, safe space for people to be real and to support others.
</p>
<p>
  Like <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/vinspired">vInspired</a>, we started this project as a small prototype and developed it gradually over time, testing, learning and making it better. I was involved with design, UX and front-end build.

  Here's a little introduction to Elefriends, narrated by Stephen Fry:
