I designed his stole, which is the white thing that goes round the neck. As I mostly work on short-term web projects it was satisfying to design something that will potentially last a long time (I can&#8217;t imagine it wearing out anywayâ€¦)</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted the design to be simple and different to the swirly gold and red crosses that are the norm in vicar land, so I stuck with one line width and one colour. The words are Jesus&#8217; from Mark 1:15, which are significant to Rich. &#8216;Repent&#8217; probably conjures up all kinds of negative thoughts, but in fact it&#8217;s really positive. It just means &#8216;turn around&#8217;, something that we all need to do from time to time. The Christian faith is good news: God is closer than we think and we&#8217;re called to turn around and believe.</span></p>
