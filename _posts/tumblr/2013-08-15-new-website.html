<p>I have finally got around to updating my site, which is something that I&#8217;ve been intending to do for many years now.</p>
<p>After lots of complex ideas, I decided to keep things really simple; One page with some info about me, this blog, and an online sketchbook of drawings and ideas. It all plays nicely on mobiles too.</p>
<p>For the nerds, I used github pages for the homepage and the rest is just a customised tumblr theme. I decided to go with tumblr over Wordpress, as I&#8217;m a big fan of how easy it is to post from their apps, and love the sharing/social side. (Also was inspired by the Tumblr founder <a href="http://sxsw.yoomee.com/post/45419166848/building-tools-for-creativity-some-ipad-notes-i" title="Founder of Tumblr" target="_blank">David Karp&#8217;s talk</a> at sxsw this year).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your feedback on the design (leave a comment below or send me a <a href="http://twitter.com/richwells" target="_blank">tweet</a>), and I promise to keep this blog more updated than the last.</p>
