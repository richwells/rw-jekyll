intro: "<p>I had my first trip to Devon and Cornwall this summer and visited the incredible village of <a href='http://www.clovelly.co.uk/village'>Clovelly</a>. Walking the steep cobbled streets it&#8217;s easy to imagine what life was like for a victorian sailor, setting off from this unique port ready to brave harsh the seas in the hope of a good catch.</p>"
