<img src="/downloads/tumblr_files/tumblr_myohx7pdMV1rr6vpvo2_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>I had my first trip to Devon and Cornwall this summer and visited the incredible village of <a href="http://www.clovelly.co.uk/village">Clovelly</a>. Walking the steep cobbled streets it&#8217;s easy to imagine what life was like for a victorian sailor, setting off from this unique port ready to brave harsh the seas in the hope of a good catch.</p>
