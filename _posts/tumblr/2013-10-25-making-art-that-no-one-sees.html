intro: "<p>We recently got back from a two week holiday in Cornwall, and before we left, my wife and I decided to take a break from social media and emails. We removed from our phones all icons which spit out numbers in red dots and made a pact not to touch them until we got back. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve done on holidays before and have always found it refreshing to properly disconnect from what&#8217;s going on at home and get some perspective. Recommend it.</p>"

<p>We recently got back from a two week holiday in Cornwall, and before we left, my wife and I decided to take a break from social media and emails. We removed from our phones all icons which spit out numbers in red dots and made a pact not to touch them until we got back. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve done on holidays before and have always found it refreshing to properly disconnect from what&#8217;s going on at home and get some perspective. Recommend it.</p>
<p>What stood out to me this holiday was that I found it hard initially to stop thinking about &#8216;sharing&#8217; stuff. I&#8217;m definitely not a social media addict, and I don&#8217;t check everything all the time, but I realised that as someone who posts quite a lot of images, I regularly think &#8216;how can I share this?&#8217; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a bad question in itself, but it can be unhealthy if it&#8217;s the main thing you have on your mind when you see something interesting. If you&#8217;re looking at a breathtaking sunset and are thinking &#8216;how can I Instagram this?&#8217;, you&#8217;re probably not enjoying the moment as much as you could be. And thinking too much about how people will react to your work before you&#8217;ve even started, can be a real creativity killer. </p>
<p>So on this social media free holiday, I decided to make art that no one would see, to make drawings and paintings, and then throw them away. It was actually quite hard at first, I felt like I was &#8216;wasting my time&#8217; and being very unproductive, but after a while I learned to enjoy the process and found it life giving.</p>

<p>I listened to music and wrote down thoughts and prayers, sometimes on top of each other. I reminded myself that God was watching, and could make sense of it all, even if I couldn&#8217;t. And most of all I began to enjoy drawing again.  Shame I can&#8217;t show you what I came up with.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m back into normal life it&#8217;s a lot harder to make space for unproductive art. There are always more important things I should probably be doing. But when I do make some space I never regret it, and am always reminded why I enjoy what I do.</p>
