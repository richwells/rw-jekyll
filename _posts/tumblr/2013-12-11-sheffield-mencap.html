Today was a nice exception as I had the opportunity to visit one of our clients, a charity called <a href="http://www.sheffieldmencap.org.uk/">Sheffield Mencap</a>. I spent a few hours with them, taking photos and seeing the work that they do, and I had a lot of fun on the way.</p>
<p>In the time I was there I popped my head into the busy kitchen to check out the cookery classes, sat in on OAP bingo, watched some energetic lads play basketball (they were big posers!), looked in on a media session and spent some time in one of their art rooms. Everyone was in full Christmas swing, with turkey sandwiches, Bing Crosby on the tinny stereo and plenty of cheesy Christmas jumpers worn by the staff. I think it might be one of the most welcoming and friendly places I have ever been to.</p>
