There&#8217;s lots of sherry, laughter, stories being shared and helpings of bread and butter pudding being enjoyed (a desert they request every year!). It&#8217;s great to join in with the fun and capture some of the incredible character of people who&#8217;ve been around for a little while longer than me!</p>
