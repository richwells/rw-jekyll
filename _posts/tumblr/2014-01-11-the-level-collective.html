<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/tumblr_files/tumblr_mz6e65o6jT1rr6vpvo3_r1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>A T-shirt design I did for <a href="http://www.thelevelcollective.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Level Collective</a>, an independent ethical clothing label based in Sheffield. They do some great work with a charity in Romania and make some quality clothing. You can buy my T-shirt <a href="http://www.thelevelcollective.co.uk/shop/faith_hope_love/" title="The Level Collective Shop">here</a>.</p>
