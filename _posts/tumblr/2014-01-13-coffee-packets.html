<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/coffee-packets.jpg"/><br/><p>After collecting coffee packets for the last 5 years (not really sure why), I have decided to do something creative with them.</p>
<p>This is my first ever coffee packet typeface. I cut each one out by hand and covered my room with stale coffee grounds - it was a labour of love! It&#8217;s early days (there aren&#8217;t any numerals or punctuation yet), but you can download the images for free here. Make something! (I&#8217;d love to know what you come up with).</p>
