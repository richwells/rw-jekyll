intro: "<p>This weekend I decided to introduce two of my colleagues to the Peak District. It&#8217;s one of the real bonuses of living in Sheffield, I love getting out to enjoy the winding roads, sheer rock faces and incredible views. Unfortunately we drove into a cloud, therefore my colleagues saw none of the above!</p>"
