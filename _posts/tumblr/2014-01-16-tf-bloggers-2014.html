<p>I saw <a href="http://www.tearfund.org/en/give/give_main/tfbloggers13/prelaunch/" title="Tearfund Bloggers" target="_blank">the advert</a> last month, and initially thought ’that’s a brilliant idea’, but didn’t consider applying myself, maybe because I don’t really think of myself as a ‘blogger’ - I mostly share images and often struggle with the writing side of things- but after some thought and encouragement from my lovely wife I decided to apply, and am glad I did!</p>
<p>I’m really excited to join <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaMathias1" title="Anita Mathias" target="_blank">Anita</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/danny_webster" title="Danny Webster" target="_blank">Danny</a> for a week in March to tell stories of the people we meet, the situations we find ourselves in, and the great work the local church is doing in Tonle Batie (the village we will be visiting). I plan to take many photos, do lots of drawings and illustrations and share it with all of you, my internet friends. More to come soon!</p>
