They were having a Charity auction to raise money for the work that they do with young people in our area who need help and support, particularly with self-esteem issues.  </p>
<p>At first when I was asked to do this, I was going to say no — two and a half hours to produce something that people would want to buy at the end of the night is pretty daunting. What if I made a mistake? What if I stood there at the front and no one wanted to buy it? But after some thought I decided to do it anyway — it&#8217;s good to do things that scare you sometimes! </p>
<p>I decided to paint something around the story of David and Goliath, the classic underdog story from the Bible. David is this pretty insignificant guy who gets left behind to look after the sheep, but actually has more courage and confidence than anyone else in the Israelite army. I think David had a confidence in who he was made to be because he knew that he was loved and known by God. What a difference it makes when we know someone cares about us and thinks we can do it!</p>
<p>The artwork was due to be auctioned at 10:30pm, but unfortunately everything was running a few minutes early, which meant me squeezing through to the front with a canvas and framing it as it was being sold. Nothing like a bit of drama to the end of the night! I was really blown away by how many bids came in, and it eventually went for £310, not bad for a couple of hours&#8217; work!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short time-lapse video of me working during the evening:</p>
