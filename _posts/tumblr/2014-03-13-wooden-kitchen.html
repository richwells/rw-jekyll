She loves anything kitchen related, and we needed somewhere to store her ever growing collection of fake food.</p>
<p>As it was going to be in our front room I didn&#8217;t want a garish pink one (why are they always pink?) and the wooden ones in John Lewis were quite expensive so I decided to make my own. &#8216;Easy&#8217; I thought. How wrong I was — I spent far too long in our cellar stooped over a work bench sanding things, sawing things, staining things and inhaling wood dust. And I loved it. It felt really good to make something with my hands and spend some quality time being creative away from a screen.</p>
<p>Big thanks to my mate Duncan Payne for the loan of man tools, and to my wife Bry for her patience!  </p>
