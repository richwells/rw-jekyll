We had three hours to spare there and decided to go and explore the city rather than sitting in the airport twiddling our thumbs. It turned out to be three hours of queueing in a taxi, with an extremely brief stopover at a temple to take some touristy photos. Slightly stressful, but I&#8217;m really glad we did it. </p>
<p>I love how everything is different over here, the heat, the smells, the colours, the people, the transport. So many things to look at! It was interesting to compare the differences between Bangkok and Phnom Penh as we arrived and drove to our hotel. Cambodia definitely feels less polished, and a lot more dusty than I imagined it would be, but we have arrived in the middle of the dry season. Not the place for jeans anyway.</p>
<p>Right, after potentially being awake for the longest I have ever been, I think it&#8217;s time I had some sleep.</p>
