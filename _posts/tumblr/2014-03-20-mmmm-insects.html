<p>I remember once hearing Michael Palin (the comedian, travel writer and Sheffielder) talk about eating food in different cultures. I can&#8217;t recall the quote word for word, but he said something like&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When someone from a different culture offers you jellied sheep&#8217;s eyeballs, don&#8217;t turn them down, you might miss the opportunity to be joyfully surprised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that I was joyfully surprised by fried insects, but they did taste quite nice. A bit like the &#8216;seaweed&#8217; you get from a Chinese restaurant back home.</p>
