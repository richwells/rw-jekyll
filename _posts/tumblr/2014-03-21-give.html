<p>Meeting people who are finding creative ways out of poverty  alongside the local church has inspired me to use my own creativity to help more people do the same.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m giving a signed print inspired by my trip to the first 60 people who give £3 a month (or more) to Tearfund.  (For a flavour of what this might look like, keep an eye on <a href="http://cambodia.richwells.me/">my scrapbook</a>)</p>
<p>Giving is really easy:</p>
<p><strong>Text HOPE TODAY to 70444<br/></strong>Texting this number will subscribe you to give £3 a month to See For Yourself, Tearfund.  It will be added to your mobile phone bill. Tearfund receives 100% of the money. This subscription service will cost £3.00 per month until you send STOP to 70080.</p>
<p><strong>Give online <br/></strong>You can donate through Tearfund&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.tearfund.org/Admin/Inpoints/Bloggers/Bloggers2014Give" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What will this money do?<br/></strong>If 60 people signed up for just £3 a month that could mean 70 new families in Cambodia could have their lives transformed through the <a href="http://brokencameras.com/2014/03/20/umoja-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Umoja process</a>. That means 70 families who can get a better education, learn new skills and lift themselves out of poverty once and for all. </p>
<p>Tearfund won&#8217;t stop until poverty stops, so please give today.</p>
