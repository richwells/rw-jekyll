intro: "<p>We&#8217;ve just come back from a two day trip to Tonle Batie, a village an hour or so out of Phnom Penh. No wifi, no 3G, and a great opportunity to spend quality time with some generous people who don&#8217;t always have it easy.</p>"

<p>We&#8217;ve just come back from a two day trip to Tonle Batie, a village an hour or so out of Phnom Penh. No wifi, no 3G, and a great opportunity to spend quality time with some generous people who don&#8217;t always have it easy.</p>

<p>Tearfund works with the local church in this community and produces regular video updates in its &#8216;See for Yourself&#8217; video series. Worth a watch.</p>

<p>Danny and I stayed with Pastor Ke Pich and his family (who is featured in the video above), and I had my first opportunity to sleep under the stars (in a mosquito net). I slept like a baby and was blown away by their hospitality over the weekend. </p>

<p>Had a bit of a nightmare when I got back when I realised that my camera wouldn&#8217;t load the photos onto my mac. Thought I&#8217;d lost them all, but after 2 hours of fiddling I&#8217;ve managed to find a way round it (turns out it was a broken lead, phew!). </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting stories from Tonle Batie over the next couple of days to <strong><a href="http://cambodia.richwells.me">my scrapbook</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Also, please consider giving to Tearfund so that more villages like Tonle Batie can be supported to help themselves out of poverty. £3/month isn&#8217;t very much, and you can even pay quickly and easily by text. I think it&#8217;s such a great cause and have decided to give away 60 art prints to the first people who give. <strong><a href="http://blog.richwells.me/post/80255761189/give" title="Give to Tearfund">Find out more</a>.</strong></p>
