intro:
  "<p>I’m posting a limited edition signed print (1 of 60) to anyone who gives £3/month to our Tearfund Cambodia challenge.</p>
  <p><strong>The inspiration</strong>I saw these two children cycling past our mini bus in one of the villages we visited. I loved their expressions and the way they worked together to keep the tiny colourful bike upright. It was a great picture of how Tearfund are supporting communities to face uncertain futures together. I had fun creating this illustration and have tried to capture some of the vibrancy and texture that I saw all around me.</p>"

<h2>How to get your print…</h2>
<p><strong>Give online </strong>You can donate through Tearfund’s website <strong><a href="http://www.tearfund.org/Admin/Inpoints/Bloggers/Bloggers2014Give" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Text HOPE TODAY to 70444</strong>Texting this number will subscribe you to give £3 a month to See For Yourself, Tearfund. It will be added to your mobile phone bill. Tearfund receives 100% of the money. This subscription service will cost £3.00 per month until you send STOP to 70080.(If you give via text, could you email me your address so I know where to post the print to? My email is rich@yoomee.com)</p>
<p><strong>What will this money do?</strong>If 60 people signed up for just £3 a month that could mean 70 new families in Cambodia could have their lives transformed through the <a href="http://brokencameras.com/2014/03/20/umoja-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Umoja process</a>. That means 70 families who can get a better education, learn new skills and lift themselves out of poverty once and for all.<a href="http://cambodia.richwells.me/"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/cambodia-shacks.jpg"/></a></p>
