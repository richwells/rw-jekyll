<p>I decided to have a bit of a break from sharing things last month after the intensity of blogging on the move in Cambodia (110 posts in 2 weeks!).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been great to spend some <a href="http://instagram.com/p/nDyHQVlg3m/">quality time with family</a> over Easter, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/nLg_6llg2v/">ride bicycles</a> and get back into my job at Yoomee â€” we&#8217;ve hired some more people, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/m5ZcM_lg7j/">knocked down a wall</a> and started some exciting <a href="http://digital.girlguiding.org.uk/introducing-yoomee">new projects</a>. Here&#8217;s a little doodle of our current team.</p>
