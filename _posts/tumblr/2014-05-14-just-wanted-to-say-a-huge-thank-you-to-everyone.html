<img src="/downloads/tumblr_files/tumblr_n5l1qt72sz1rr6vpvo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p><span>Just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who gave to our </span><a href="http://www.tearfund.org/en/give/give_main/tfbloggers13/live/" target="_blank">#tfbloggers campaign</a><span>. Forty-one people signed up to give regularly, and it&#8217;s only after speaking to a few charity fundraisers that I&#8217;ve realised how incredible that number is. I&#8217;m sorting out the artwork prints this week and will be sending them out as soon as I can. <br/><br/></span></p>

<h2><br/>Still want to give?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not too late to give and get some free artwork! giving is easy:</p>
<p><strong>Give online <br/></strong>You can donate through Tearfund’s website <strong><a href="http://www.tearfund.org/Admin/Inpoints/Bloggers/Bloggers2014Give" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Text HOPE TODAY to 70444</strong><br/>Texting this number will subscribe you to give £3 a month to See For Yourself, Tearfund. It will be added to your mobile phone bill. Tearfund receives 100% of the money. This subscription service will cost £3.00 per month until you send STOP to 70080.<br/>(If you give via text, could you email me your address so I know where to post the print to? My email is rich@yoomee.com)</p>
<p><strong>What will this money do?<br/></strong>If 60 people signed up for just £3 a month that could mean 70 new families in Cambodia could have their lives transformed through the <a href="http://brokencameras.com/2014/03/20/umoja-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Umoja process</a>. That means 70 families who can get a better education, learn new skills and lift themselves out of poverty once and for all.</p>
