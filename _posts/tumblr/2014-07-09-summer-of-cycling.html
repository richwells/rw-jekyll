intro: "Watching The Tour pass through Yorkshire last weekend was incredible. It was like having the World Cup come to your local park - so great to watch a major sporting event happen on the familiar roads of the Peak District and brilliant to see how the whole of Yorkshire got behind it."

<p>I&#8217;ve always been into bicycles, even before they were cool and Britain started winning things on them (not any more mind you thanks to the cobbles). I&#8217;ve watched the Tour de France every year since I was a kid and have fond memories of huddling round our TV with pitiful Channel 4 reception trying to pick out riders from the white noise (no chance when it was raining!).Â </p>

<p>To celebrate the Tour coming up north I did a <a href="http://www.thelevelcollective.co.uk/shop/strong-and-northern/" target="_blank">T-shirt design</a> for the Level Collective. Henderson&#8217;s Relish appreciators might notice the subtle orange label in the bottle cage!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re nearly sold out but have a few left in stock <strong><a href="http://www.thelevelcollective.co.uk/shop/strong-and-northern/" title="Strong and Northern by Rich Wells" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
